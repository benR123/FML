FML
===

An analog card game I made with 4 other people (January 2014 - May 2014).

The game FML was a 15 week project designed by a team of five people, including me. The game was a card game based around one group (the employees) teaming up and trying to 
outlast a single character (the boss) who is more powerful. All players have a level of stress that rises or falls as the day progresses. Players draw cards that raise and 
lower their stress or raise and lower other players’ stress. When the player reaches too high a stress level (100), they must “retire” and quit playing. The game ends when 
either the boss out lasts all of the employees or the employees get the boss to quit. We took a large amount of inspiration from the movie Office Space, and that dark, 
irreverent humor and the shtick of the drags of white-collar office life are present throughout the game. We built our game with the kind of office workers that would 
appreciate this type of satire in mind.

We had a great deal of fun making this game and the entire team enjoyed working together on a project we all enjoyed. Overall, I consider this game well-made but it was not 
without its frustrations and flaws. The largest problem (and what we spent most of our time working on) was trying to balance the cards and characters. Throughout the 
development process, our game vacillated between being too easy to lose and too easy to not lose (in keeping with the sardonic humor of the game, the player doesn’t really 
“win” as much as he or she loses last). Since our gameplay revolved around adding, subtracting, and multiplying a score, we have a lot of trouble finding the perfect balance 
between challenging and frustrating. Secondly, our boss required a deft touch to ensure that the character was powerful enough to fight four others at a time but not too 
powerful to instantly win. While our game took a very large amount of finagling, by the end we were able to more-or-less find the sweet-spot and come up with a balanced, 
rewarding game.

My contribution to the game came in the form of balancing. Everybody worked on properly balancing the cards and characters, but I spent a great deal of time focusing on that
specific problem. By no means do I take sole credit for the balance of the game, but I devoted a great deal of time and energy on that specific problem. In addition, I played
a large part in designing the initial gameplay mechanics (i.e. the stress score, how it was incremented and decremented, etc.). The entire project was a group effort and 
everybody worked on everything at least a little bit, but I concentrated on these specific things.
